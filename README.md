## Ultimate Frisbee data set

This repository contains the data sets used for the analyses by Ultiworld statistics editors. The data was collected with Ultiapps. Unlike other data sets, this one tracks the approximate location of the disc enabling spatial analysis. 

There are several data sets, including Nexgen and Club ultimate.
